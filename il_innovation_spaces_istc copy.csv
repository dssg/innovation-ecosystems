An &ldquo;institute without walls,&rdquo; the CLP provides the infrastructure necessary to help articulate and explore emerging research questions across the disciplines of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, medicine, and computational science. The Institute&rsquo;s role in promoting scientific discovery is shaped by the fundamental recognition that established institutional boundaries must be transcended to produce transformative scientific advances. Proceeding from the premise that interdisciplinary approaches to science can generate these advances in ways that traditional, single-discipline methodology cannot, CLP fosters collaborative research at the interface of the chemical, physical, engineering, and life sciences. In providing the organizational philosophy, administrative structure, and physical environment necessary to sustain these cross-disciplinary collaborations, the Institute reduces barriers that typically impede major scientific discoveries. And by uniting scholars from disparate disciplines to investigate emerging research questions that require the formulation of new paradigms and the application of novel methods, CLP also creates the conditions necessary for a new wave of scientific innovation on the Northwestern campus. CLP&rsquo;s catalytic role in the discovery process will be complemented by a parallel endeavor to maximize the beneficial impact of its findings through translational research. The centerpiece of this effort will be the implementation of an Integrated Program for Molecular Therapeutics, which will provide a pipeline linking drug discovery to pre-clinical testing by capitalizing on the Institute&rsquo;s established clinical partnerships and key strengths in high throughput screening, imaging, and proteomics.

These four machines offer great flexibility in the range of materials grown and in the in situ characterization techniques available to the grower. The Riber 32P MBE system is configured for the growth of HgCdTe layers and superlattices. This chamber is equipped with a valved Hg cell and an indium cell for n-type doping. It is also equipped with a state-of-the-art Woollam M2000 Spectroscopic Ellipsometer capable of in situ measurement of the dielectric function of the growing surface in the spectral range of 0.7 to 5.0 eV. Two Riber 2300 systems are configurable for the growth of various materials including wide band II-VI and thin magnetic layers. Finally, the Riber Opus system is primarily configured for the growth of CdTe on large (up to 5 inch) Si substrates. The in situ characterization techniques attached to the four growth chambers include RHEED, spectroscopic ellipsometry, XPS and AES. A clean room which is constructed following the Federal Standard 209e Class 10K, contains all MBE chambers as well as three complete chemical hoods for sample preparation. In addition, MPL also has a RF magnetron sputtering system, several thermal evaporation systems, as well as sol-gel and chemical deposition facilities for poly-crystalline or nano-scale crystalline film deposition or growth.  2) Ex situ characterization facilities Electrical characterization facilities in MPL include Hall effect and other current-voltage measurement equipment (fully automated from 300 K down to 8 K). This equipment can be upgraded in order to perform photonic-electrical-magnetic measurements to determine carrier diffusion lengths and recombination lifetimes. It can also perform I-V device characterization measurements from 8 K to room temperature. Bruker D8 Discover High resolution X-ray diffraction System with Ge 4-bounce monochrometer and Ge 3-bounce path finder to measure crystal rocking curve (RC) FWHMäó»s of the epitaxial layers.

It also includes the research protections group (formerly ORP).  In the past year, we have reshuffled personnel and changed responsibilities to include a small group whose charge is to work on grants compliance policies as well as a separate group to work on Research Development and outreach. Research Development and Pre Award:	Responding to the continuously evolving needs of both investigators and funding agencies has defined the services and goals of the Pre-award Services unit of the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research.  The functions associated with this activity typically encompass every aspect of a research project, from assistance in articulation of a concept to providing operational support throughout the lifecycle of a proposal.  More specifically, pre award provides assistance in the identification of funding sources, interpretation of Request for Proposals (RFP), budget development, and in proposal development including consultation and coordination of interdisciplinary and inter-University projects and facilitating the process of proposal submission to external funding agencies.  	The Research Development activities are centered on creating a more vibrant Scholarly Community and enhancing the role of research.  Rather than focus on funding, their charge is to provide research support and outreach to the DePaul community.  This can be individual, departmental or College-level support.  Examples of these activities might include creating a long-term research plan and a funding plan to go with it; it might be a workshop on how to balance research with teaching a service, or it could be a grant-writing workshop.  Post Award and Grants Compliance:   	The primary functions of the post-award side are to coordinate, review, negotiate and accept grant awards.  The office initiates the establishment of grant accounts following PI notification.  The office works with faculty, beginning with a one-on-one orientation session to review the terms of the grant, federal regulations and institutional requirements.  If awards require modification, the post-award office will work with them and the granting agency to secure the extention/change.  The office also works with Deans and PIs to ensure that reporting milestones are met.  Throughout the life of the award, the post-award office provides technical support for award management through close-out. 	We have added the role of grants policies and compliance to this group.  Their role is to create standard policies and guidelines where we currently have none.  We found that in several cases, DePaul has no policies to address basic grants issues and each time a problem or question arises, it is handled as a brand new event.  We are working with different academic units, OGC as well as restricted accounting to develop policies and guidelines.  This group is also responsible for the regular review of policies that relate to ORS (e.g. conflict of interest, scientific misconduct, etc.).  Finally, this group has been active in creating training modules to familiarize faculty, staff and students with specific procedures as they relate to funding.Research Protections Group  	The Office of Research Protections (ORP) supports three committees that review and approve research and other activities at DePaul University; 1) The Institutional Review Board (IRB), 2) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and 3) Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The IRB is responsible for reviewing research involving human subjects conducted at DePaul or by DePaul faculty, staff, or students. The IACUC is responsible for ensuring the proper care and humane treatment of vertebrate animals used in research and educational activities at DePaul University. The IBC is responsible for ensuring the safe acquisition, use, and disposal of all biohazardous agents at DePaul University, particularly procedures or techniques that involve recombinant DNA, Center for Disease Control (CDC) designated Select Agents, or potentially infectious materials, such as human blood. The Office of Research Protections provides administrative support for the three committees and ensures that DePaul University, as an institution, is compliant with the federal regulations and guidance that pertain to these three committees.",,,,,DePaul University,IL,No,Northeast Illinois-Chicagoland Region,Grants,,Research Center/Facilities,,,,"Clean Tech/Alternative Energy, Food/Agriculture, IT/Digital/Web-Mobile, Manufacturing, Biotech and Life Sciences, Healthcare and Medical Devices, Nanotechnology, Transportation/Logistics, Social/Impact Venture, Telecommunications",X,,template.php,default.css,,,181,1,,No,George R. and Martha Means Center for Entrepreneurial Studies,filebin/martha_center.png,No,,Illinois State University College of Business,470 S.

It is the agency's most frequently used financial assistance program because of its flexibility in loan structure, variety of loan proceed uses, and availability. The program has broad eligibility requirements and credit criteria to accommodate a wide range of financing needs. The business loans that SBA guarantees do not come from the agency, but rather from banks and other approved lenders.The loans are funded by these organizations, and they make the decisions to approve or not approve the applicants' requests. The SBA guaranty reduces the lender's risk of borrower non-payment. If the borrower defaults, the lender can request SBA to pay the lender that percentage of the outstanding balance guaranteed by SBA. This allows the lender to recover a portion from SBA of what it lent if the borrower can't make the payments.The borrower is still obligated for the full amount. To qualify for an SBA loan, a small business must meet the lender's criteria and the 7(a) requirements. In addition, the lender must certify that it would not provide this loan under the proposed terms and conditions unless it can obtain an SBA guaranty. If the SBA is going to provide a lender with a guaranty, the applicant must be eligible and creditworthy and the loan structured under conditions acceptable to SBA.</p>",,,,,U. S.

And you don&rsquo;t even have to quit your current job while you&rsquo;re enrolled in this program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Chicago based training program in web development will transform you from a total newbie into a professional software engineer. By the end of the 12 weeks, you&rsquo;ll be able to land an entry level or apprenticeship position in web programming. And we&rsquo;ll help you get there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As you may know, there are a number of other &ldquo;code bootcamps&rdquo; out there, coming in all sorts of shapes and sizes. We&rsquo;re different in three major ways:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1) Most other training programs require you to give up everything else you&rsquo;re doing in life (like your&nbsp;<em>job</em>), and commit 40 to 80 (!) hours a week to your training. While that&rsquo;s nice in theory, that&rsquo;s pretty difficult for most people to pull off. We allow you to keep your job while you&rsquo;re training, as our classes are conducted on Sundays and weeknights.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2) The current mainstream &ldquo;code bootcamp&rdquo; model is to skimp on instruction, claiming that the best way to learn to code is by way of hands-on experience. The students are provided with reading material and are expected to teach&nbsp;<em>themselves</em>&nbsp;how to code, while the &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; assume more of a guide role by helping out students who get stuck or have questions. We believe that to go from 0 to 60 in just a few months, you need plenty of high quality instruction&nbsp;<em>in conjunction</em>&nbsp;with lots of hands-on experience to effectively learn and absorb so much material at such a fast rate. Now, our instruction does not consist of boring lectures, but of interactive discussion interspersed with hands-on exercises so that the students can immediately practice what they&rsquo;ve just learned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3) Code bootcamps are generally taught by people who are quite skilled at coding, but not necessarily at teaching. The Anyone Can Learn To Code bootcamp is taught by&nbsp;<a href=""http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/about"" target=""_blank"">Jay Wengrow</a>, a practicing web developer who comes from a background in education, having Masters degrees in&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;computer science&nbsp;<em>and</em>education. He is known for his unique ability to take complex technical concepts and break them down in such a way that make them easy to understand, so that anyone can understand them. We challenge you to watch his&nbsp;<a href=""http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/screencasts"" target=""_blank"">Ruby screencast series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;learn how to write your first computer program.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The specifics of the program are as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Winter course will officially begin on January 4th and end April 19th. The first 3 weeks will be pre-work you can do from home. This will prepare you immensely for the 12 weeks of in-class instruction starting January 25th. Jay Wengrow will be available during this time to help and answer any questions you may have.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Starting January 25th, classes will be held on Sunday from 9 AM &ndash; 5 PM, and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday evenings from 6 PM &ndash; 9:30 PM. We will be located at 1871, the iconic tech hub in the Merchandise Mart in downtown Chicago. Because this program is designed for working people, there is no extra homework outside of class.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You will get a solid grasp on the following technologies: Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, SQL, and Git. We will also teach you to code according to industry best practices, including Agile, Test Driven Development, and Service Oriented Architecture (APIs). API development is huge nowadays, and most bootcamps ignore it and just teach you &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; Rails. You don&rsquo;t want to apply for a job and discover that your skills are out of date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>During the second half of the program, we will help you with the job search process. In addition to the portfolio of projects you will be building to show off your work, we will connect you to our growing network of recruiters and businesses who are seeking fresh technical talent. We will also help you optimize your resume and LinkedIn and Github profiles to make sure they&rsquo;re in line with what employers are looking for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although you need no previous programming experience, there will be three weeks of introductory work which is part of the 12 weeks of course work as mentioned above. This will help all students speed up the learning process and make sure that everyone starts out on the same page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tuition is $8,000 for the entire program. That works out to be roughly $30 per hour of actual instruction, besides for the out-of-class meetings and career support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can begin the application process by filling out the short form below. We&rsquo;ll follow up with you shortly and set up an interview so we can learn more about you and make sure this program is right for you. We are looking for students who demonstrate dedication and the ability to work hard, because there will be plenty of work and exercises that need to be completed in a timely manner so you don&rsquo;t fall behind. We&rsquo;ll help you every step of the way, but this program will nonetheless demand your focus and diligence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you have any questions about our program, please reach out to us by filling out the form below and we&rsquo;ll get back to you in short order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can also download our&nbsp;<a href=""http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/ACLTC-Brochure.pdf"">ACLTC Brochure</a></p><p><span style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""line-height: 28px;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,template.php,default.css,,,656,3,ea8c307b222d6b2ea33d44c2605bcabb376f7fea,Yes,New Idea Solutions Inc. - e-Commerce Patent Holder,,Yes,jsteinecker@comcast.net,,,,0,,12/3/14 14:36,12/3/14 14:36,0000-00-00 00:00:00,1,New Idea Solutions Inc. - e-Commerce Patent Holder,,,,Jeffrey Steinecker,630-215-7119,www.newideasolutions.com,,"We represent our founders patent on a revolutionary e-commerce solution that protects users identity and spending while increasing service levels from vendors.
